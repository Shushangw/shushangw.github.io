I am a PhD candidate in the School of Cyber Science and Technology at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof.[Jingqiang Lin](https://lin-jingqiang.github.io/). Besides, I am also honored to collaborate with Prof. [Bingyu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=_pqPCqcAAAAJ) and Dr. [Yiming Zhang](https://cypher-z.github.io/). Prior to that, I got my BS degree in Computer Science and Technology from Hefei University of Technology (HFUT) in 2020. 

My research interests include email security, public key infrastructure, and transparency. I focus on empirical, data-driven studies to evaluate the real-world impact of security threats, with the goal of providing valuable insights to the community and contributing to strengthening Internet security.

<span style="color:red;">**Looking for Research Opportunities:**</span> I am happy to engage in discussions on security-related topics with researchers worldwide. Additionally, I am actively seeking internship opportunities to collaborate with different research groups. Please feel free to reach out to me at [sswen@mail.ustc.edu.cn](mailto:sswen@mail.ustc.edu.cn)!
